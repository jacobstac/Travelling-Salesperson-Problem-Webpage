# The project


## Intro

The Traveling Salesperson Simulator will become a mindblowing interactive webpage where you, the user, will experience the wonderful world of gluing together different pre-made algorithms to create the shortest tour between different cities. The best results will 



## Project plan and progress
The project has different modules, each of significant importance.


### TSP_Engine:
1. Create tsp engine.
    a. make the engine read input
    b.  I. Make a distance matrix of all cities
        II. (later on) MAKE ORDERED ADJENCENCY LISTS FOR EACH CITY
    c. make a initial tour (gready and random)
    d. Make tour improvement algorithms for example:
        I. localRandom
        II. Two opt
        III. Two point Five opt
    e. Print the results

### Front End
1. Make the webpage:
    a. create a basic webpage
    b. create a way of showing the results of the tsp algorithm on the webpage
    c. create a way of visualize the results of the tsp algorithm on the webpage
    d. create a way of choosing different algorithms for creating a tsp algorithm
    e. create a score board which saves the results (idea: data base, also a check so no users can name them self bad words)
